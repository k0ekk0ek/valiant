v 1.  Remove cfg_opt_t arrays from vt_type_t and vt_map_type_t structures.
v 2.  Rename vt_<check>_t to vt_check_<check>_t.
v 3.  Rename vt_type_t to vt_check_type_t.
v 4.  Implement staging.
v 5.  Remove type.h and move it's contents to check.h.
v 6.  Rename "attribute" to member in check configuration section.
v 7.  Rename member "context" in vt_map_type_t and member "info" in vt_type_t
      to data.
v 8.  Move some of the configuration validation to libconfuse. See:
      http://www.nongnu.org/confuse/manual/ftpconf_8c-example.html
v 9.  Move some of the check creation to check_alloc and rename it to
      check_create.
v 10. Move map list creation to a seperate function.
  11. Make vt_stage_create also do map list creation.
v 12. Make vt_check_*_create also do map list creation.
v 13. Rename vt_set_select_map_id to vt_set_get_map_id.
v 14. Rename vt_set_insert_map to vt_set_set_map.
v 15. Consolidate set.x en map.x and rename certain functions.
v 16. Rename vt_set_t to something else, the name is confusing.
      >> maybe choose vt_map_list_t?
v 17. Create enum for map results. >> Think of good names for the result, look
      at Postfix and other policy servers for ideas.
v 18. Create enum for request members.
v 19. Rename constants.h to valiant.h.
  20. Create check variant (check_map) that does a map lookup and increments
      the score with the specified value.
v 21. Finish implementation of stages.
  22. Expand configuration validation.
  23. Find out what extra configuration options should be available to control
      program execution etc.
      Example: http://code.google.com/p/gross/wiki/NewConfigFileFormat
v 24. Implement request parsing.
v 25. Implement syslog support.
v 26. Implement debug support.
v 27. Make API changes to support new statistics gathering method.
  28. Implement support for reloading and verify all unused memory etc gets
      cleaned up.
  29. Implement support for SPF checks.
  30. Make it a daemon.
  31. Design the context to contain the stages, maps, checks etc.
  32. Add posibility to add default result to map, per check.
  33. Stage should know how much the following stages can influence the score
      and make decisions based on that knowledge.
  34. Implement temporary error codes, this should allow us to not reject all
      incoming messages when an error occurs.
  35. Introduce small API changes, use pthread_* functions as an example.
  36. Implement assertions.
  37. Allocating the struct outside the function, and using a seperate init
      function is the right way to go.
  38. We might be able to have fixed sized buffers for the request structure,
      this would eliminate of a lot of system calls, be less error prone and
      speed up the program.
  39. It's probably a good idea to switch to using GLib. This will make a lot
      of code unnecessary (e.g. thread_pool.x and slist.x) plus provide a lot
      of functions for dealing with idn etc.
  X.  Implement vt_map_pgsql_t.
  X.  Document code.
  X.  Implement IPv6 support for DNSBL checks.
